### Hi animators and TDs

I'm a freelance rigging TD @ Rigmarole Studio, creating rigs and Python animation pipeline tools for small companies in the 3D animated film and games industry. I dabble in generative art, music production and sailing.

I blog at [Rigmarole Studio](https://rigmarolestudio.com/) and you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrislesage) and [Instagram]https://www.instagram.com/rigmarolestudio/
